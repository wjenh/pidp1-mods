The important documentation on how to use dynamic IOTs is in the ../Docs directory.
You really need to read it.

Type32Drum has the implementation of the Type 32 Parallel Drum. It is also installed here.

Clock has the implementation of the BBN timesharing clock. It is not installed by default, copy IOT_32.c
here if you want to use it.
