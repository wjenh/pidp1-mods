Each of three IOTs for the drum expect parameters in the IO register.
The proper IOTs for the drum are:

IOT 61,  72xx61, dia
IOT 2061 722061, dba same as dia except requests a break on channel 5 when the i/o is done
   IO rfffffaaaaaaaaaaaa
      r             1 if a read is requested else 0
      fffff         the drum 'field' to read from, 0-037, 0-31 dec
      aaaaaaaaaaaa  the drum address within the field to begin from

IOT 62,   72xx62, dwc
   IO wfffffcccccccccccc
      w             1 if a write is requested else 0
      fffff         the drum 'field' to write to, 0-037, 0-31 dec
      cccccccccccc  the number of 18 bit words to read and/or write, 0-07777, 0-4095 dec, 0 means 4096

IOT 2062, 722062, dra
   current drum address -> IO, 0-07777, 0-4095 dec

IOT 63,  72xx63, dcl
   IO 00bbbbaaaaaaaaaaaa
      bbbb          the memory bank to read and/or write, 0-017, 0-15 dec
      aaaaaaaaaaaa  the memory address within the bank to begin from

The actual operation begins when dcl is executed.
Both the drum and memory addresses wrap around if the tranfer count plus the starting address exceeds 4096.

A simultaneous read/write can be done.
For this, the read happens first then the write for each word.
The implementation actually reads all the data, then writes all the data, then copies the read data into memory.
The effect is the same, but see below.

Bit 17 in cks is the busy flag, CKS_DRP, 000001.
It is set when the drum is executing a read or write, cleared when done.

The actual drum advances one word every 8.5 microseconds, which means the current drum address is incremented
at that interval.  An effort is made to simualate this.
A transfer will take (counts for drum to reach starting drum address + number of words to read/write) * 8.5 us.
Because of the granularity of the simulator clock, the time to reach the starting address is slightly inaccurate,
but the read/write time is exact to 4 us.

However, all the data is actually transferred within the dcl IOT, it's only the busy or interrupt that is held
until the simulated completion time. In practice, this should not have any effect on existing code.
