# Pidp-1 mods updates

This contains files modified from https://github.com/obsolescence/pidp1 to add new functionality.
Note that this may or may not be tracked in the original repo, so apply with care.

# Installing and building

It contains a full build tree.
Make a clean /opt/pidp1 directory, move into it, check this out.
Everything after this proceeds as for the original install.

# **NOTE**

The one checkout difference is that the original had you check out in /opt.
Again, this one you check out in an empty /opt/pidp1 directory.
Of course, you're probably reading this after checking out in your /opt directory.
Sorry, it's just the way I set up the repo initially, made sense at the time.
