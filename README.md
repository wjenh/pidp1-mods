# Pidp-1 mods updates

This contains files modified from https://github.com/obsolescence/pidp1 to add new functionality.
Note that this may or may not be tracked in the original repo, so apply with care.

# Installing and building

It contains a full build tree.
By default, it will reside in /opt/pidp1-mods but this can be changed.
Look at install/install.sh and change INSTALLHOME and/or INSTALLDIR as desired.

Make a clean /opt/pidp1-mods (or whatever you set in the script) directory, move into it, check this out there.
Everything after this proceeds as for the original install.

# **NOTE**

Again,the  one checkout difference is that the original had you check out in /opt.
This one you check out in an empty /opt/pidp1-mods directory.
Of course, you're probably reading this after checking out in your /opt directory.
Sorry, it's just the way I set up the repo initially, made sense at the time.
